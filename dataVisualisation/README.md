The Sonic Solar System

The Sonic Solar System uses data from the last.fm API on artists, songs and plays.

The code then generates a randomly coloured system of planets which correspond to a song. The planet size is dependent on the amount of plays that song has. The more plays, the larger the planet. The planets orbit a sun which represents the artist being analysed. The speed of orbit decreases with size and radius of orbit.

By inputting a new artist into the text box and pressing the button to submit, the system is regenerated with a new set of songs from the new artist.
